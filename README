== Usage

[source,java]
----
OtpValidator validator = new OtpValidator();
String result = validator.validate(otp, clientId);

if(result == AuthenticationResult.OK) {
  /* The OTP is valid! Now we want to check that the YubiKey belongs
   * to this user. To do this, we need to compare the ID of the YubiKey
   * used to generate the OTP with the YubiKey associated with the user's
   * account.
   *    
   * For example:
   */
  
  String yubikeyId = OtpUtils.getYubikeyId(otp)
  if(yubiKeyId == user.yubikeyId__c) {
    // Successfully authenticated!
  } else {
    // The wrong YubiKey was used for this user.
  }
} else {
  // Invalid OTP
}
----

For a more thorough usage example, see `docs/Usage_Example.adoc`.

== Optional utility methods

Although not at all required, you sometimes might want to extract the
YubiKey Serial Number from an OTP. This serial number will match the
8-digit number that is printed on the device.


[source,java]
----
// The first 12 characters of an OTP represents the serial number of the key
String serialNumberEncoded = otp.substring(0, 12);
String serialNumber = ModHex.getSerialNumber(serialNumberEncoded);
